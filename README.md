<html> <h2>Facial Emotion Detection</h1>
        <p>A multi-class image classification project developed using deep learning techniques for accurate prediction of emotionsâ€”Happy, Sad, Neutral, and Surprise. 
        Several models developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and finetuned with Transfer Learning Models (VGG 16, ResNet V2, EfficientNet). 
                Data Augmentation, Hyperparameter Tuning and Regularization Techniques were used to improve the model performance. 
                Project was developed in Google Colab environment using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Seaboarn and Matplotlib</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>CNN model developed using four convolutional layers with each having 64, 32, 128, 256 neurons and MaxPooling along with relu activation connected to a fully connected layer with 512 neurons shown the best performance of 87% training and 78% tetsing accuracy. 
                To address overfitting batch Normalization and Droupouts were implemented with different learning rates of Adam optimization algorithm.
                The top-performing model demonstrated over 90% accuracy in classifying Happy and Surprise emotions but majorly confused between Neutral and Sad emotions</p>
